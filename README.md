## Future Plans

As a future direction, we plan to enhance the functionality of our to-do list web application by allowing users to view more details about their tasks. Specifically, we aim to incorporate features such as categorization, task descriptions, and due dates to help users better organize their to-do lists. We look forward to continuing to develop and improve our application to better meet the needs of our users.
